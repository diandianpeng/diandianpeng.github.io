I am a postdoctoral scholar at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/), [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), working with [Dr. Dave Stegman](https://dstegman.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/) on slab-plume interaction dynamics. I earned my Ph.D. in Geology from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, under the supervision of Dr. Lijun Liu. Prior to that, I received both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Geophysics from the University of Science and Technology of China.

My research interests encompass various aspects of geophysics, including geodynamics, plate tectonics, mantle heterogeneities, seismic anisotropy, and the topographic responses to mantle convection.

Global data-assimilation models

To understand the Earth's dynamic evolution, I employ global thermal-chemical models incorporating data assimilation. The simulations provide insights into the formation and development of Large Low-Shear-Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs), the complex interplay between mantle plumes and subducted slabs, and the generation of realistic surface topography. These model results align with multidisciplinary observations, offering a comprehensive understanding of various geological phenomena.

Subduction beneath East Asia
======
One of my research focuses is reconstructing the subduction history of the Izanagi and Pacific plates beneath East Asia. By analyzing geological records and geophysical observations, I aim to elucidate the complex subduction and tectonic processes that have shaped this region.

Flat subduction of the Izanagi slab

My research has identified a continental-scale flat Izanagi slab beneath East Asia during the Late Cretaceous. This unique subduction event provides a compelling explanation for several key geological features in the region, including lithospheric structure, magmatic activity, and surface uplift/subsidence patterns. Prolonged subduction is likely the primary driver of this flat slab configuration

Stagnant slab beneath East Asia

My models successfully reproduced the observed stagnant slab beneath East Asia. We propose a novel mechanism in which the formation of this stagnant slab is primarily controlled by a regional westward mantle flow driven by the subduction of the sinking Izanagi slab. Additionally, the simulated seismic anisotropy derived from mantle flow aligns with seismic observations, further supporting the existence of this mantle wind

The subduction of Tonga slab and opening of the Lau Basin

The Tonga-Kermadec subduction zone, characterized by its exceptionally high convergence rate, presents a significant challenge for modeling subduction dynamics. To address this, we employed a novel boundary condition incorporating nonlinear rheology. Our model successfully reproduced the observed slab structure and the opening of the Lau Basin. We found that the eastward migration of the Lau Ridge is linked to the basin's formation.
