I am a postdoctoral scholar at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/), [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). I am working with [Dr. Dave Stegman] (https://dstegman.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/) at UCSD. I earned my Ph.D. degree at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign under the advisory of Dr. Lijun Liu. I earned my master's degree and bachelor's degree at University of Scientific and Technology of China.

My research is focused on geophysics, including but not limited to geodynamics, plate tectonics, mantle rheology, mantle heterogeneities and topography.

Global data-assimilation models
======
I run global thermal chemical data-assimilation models to study the evolution of the Earth's interior.

Subduction beneath East Asia
======
Flat subduction of the Izanagi slab
------
We discovered a continental-scale flat slab beneath East Asia in late Cretaceous. This flat subduction explains the lithospheric structure of East Asia.

Stagnant slab beneath East Asia
------
We proposed that the formation of the stagnant slab beneath East Asia is mainly controlled by a regional westward mantle wind induced by the sinking Izanagi slab.
